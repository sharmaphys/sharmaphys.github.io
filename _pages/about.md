I am a computational scientist working on the interface of cheminformatics/structural-biology and data science. I received both M.S and Ph.D in Physics from
the [University of Connecticut](https://physics.uconn.edu/) and M.S in Physics from [Tribhuvan University](https://tucdp.edu.np/).

My current research focuses on drug discovery on various oncogenic targets. Driven by the profound interest in the interface of 
structural-biology/cheminformatics, I leverage the state-of-the art technonogies in molecular modeling including physics based simulations, machine learning (ML)/ deep learning
(DL) etc. 

I truly believe the future is data and the future of drug discovery with AI/ML is already here.
Levereging data centric approach and employing the recent trends in the field like generative modeling, geometric deep learning, 
large language models etc. will keep us moving forward in achieving our goals and ultimately help the society and its citizens through science.

With this objective in mind, I look forward to work in this direction and utilize these application in my day to day work. I am excited 
to see what the future brings.
