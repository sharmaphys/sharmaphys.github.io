I am a computational scientist working on the interface of 
cheminformatics/structural-biology and data science. I truly believe the future is data.
Levereging data centric approach and employing the recent trends in the field like generative modeling, geometric deep learning, 
large language models etc will keep us moving forward in achieving our goals and ultimately help the society and its citizens through science.

With this objective in mind, I look forward to work in this direction and utilize these application in my day to day work. I am excited 
to see what the future brings.
