      institution: <strong>StemSynergy THERAPEUTICS INC. </strong>
      year: OCT 2021 - Present 
      description:
        - Strategically led the computational part of molecular modeling, drug discovery, and structural biology. Leveraged state-of-the-art technologies.
        - Collaborated and transparently communicated results with colleagues from the chemistry and biology departments and stake holders. 
                Custom-built LINUX computer clusters with GPUs and CPUs
        - Wrote a substantial amount of Python scripts to analyze huge volumes of data generated from molecular dynamics simulations. 
                Conducted unsupervised machine learning algorithms using k-means clustering on a custom build cluster. 
                Implemented the script so that 10M+ data points could efficiently be clustered into 14k+ clusters in less than 30 minutes
